# Module 02 Penetraion Testing Scoping and Engagement

## Penetration Testing: Pre-engagement Activities

- Pre-engagement activities set the foundation for managing and successfully executing a penetration testing engagement.
- These pre-engagement activities constitute an important component in penetration testing and should not be overlooked by a pen tester or client.
- If the client and pen tester fail to properly follow the pre-engagement activities, they may face issues such as scope creeping, unsatisfied customers, and even legal issues in their penetration testing engagement.
- The pre-engagement activities in a penetration test start with determining the goal of the test.

**Penetration Testing: Pre-engagement Activities**

Pre-engagement activities help establish a clear understanding between the client and penetration tester. They set the foundation for managing and successfully executing a penetration testing engagement. These pre-engagement activities constitute an important component in penetration testing and should not be overlooked by a penetration tester or client. If the client and pen tester fail to properly follow the pre-engagement activities, they may face issues such as scope creeping, unsatisfied customers, and even legal issues in their penetration testing engagement. The pre-engagement activities in a penetration test start with determining the goal of the test.

The primary objectives for conducting pre-engagement activities are as follows:

- Evaluate the scope of penetration testing.

- Understand the type of penetration testing required.

- Determine the penetration test procedure.

- Identify the amount of resources needed for the test.

- Outline the rules of engagement (ROE).

- Determine the metrics for estimating the time and cost of the test.

- Estimate the overall cost.

- Ascertain the limits of engagement.

- Learn about the laws in the jurisdiction of the test location.

## Initiation of a Pen Testing Engagement Process

An RFP is an invitation to penetration testers to submit their proposals of penetration testing services to the client organization. The client first distributes an RFP document to various penetration testing vendors or publishes one, asking the vendors to submit proposals before a due date. The main purpose of the RFP is to inform the vendors about the penetration testing opportunity and allow them to submit bids on various platforms such as websites, portals, and other applications.

An RFP helps organizations select an appropriate vendor that can meet their requirements and provide quality services. This RFP template also lists a set of questions related to different domains that the organization uses to assess and evaluate the proficiency of vendors. 

The following are the contents of an RFP.

- **Purpose of the RFP**

  The goals of the organization in relation to penetration testing are as follows:

  - Evaluate the security of the organization.
  - Identify any security issues that will impact the business.
  - Submit the findings and recommendations.

- **Technical and contractual contact**

  This component has contact details of individuals to contact for proposal submission, specifications, SOW requirements, contract terms, conditions, and so on. The following table presents a format that can be used for each contact.

  | Name    | John |
  | ------- | ---- |
  | Address |      |
  | Phone   |      |
  | Email   |      |

- **Schedule of events**

  This component specifies the timetable for events before engagement. The following table presents sample schedule of events.

  | Event                                              | Date |
  | -------------------------------------------------- | ---- |
  | RFP distribution to vendors                        |      |
  | Questions from vendors about scope of approach due |      |
  | Responses to vendors about scope or approach due   |      |
  | Proposal due date                                  |      |
  | Target date for review of proposals                |      |
  | Anticipated decision and selection of vendors      |      |
  | Anticipated commencement date of work              |      |

## Proposal Submission

The RFP provides details of the selection standards and procedures set by the organization. It also includes guidelines for filling the proposal document and the rights of the organization. Before submitting the proposal, the penetration tester should read the document carefully and understand all the conditions and disclaimers mentioned in it. 

The organization awards the contract to the penetration tester whose proposal, in response to the RFP, is the most responsive and requires relatively low resources such as time and cost. The organization has the following rights while awarding contracts to vendors: 

- It can deny any or all offers and suspend the entire RFP process without any liability to the vendors.

- There is no rule dictating that organization must award the contract to vendor who offered the lowest price. The firm has the right to reject the lowest-price offer and select the vendor as per its requirements.

- The organization can also select the vendor on a first-come-first-serve basis, without considering or waiting for the best offer.

- It can award more than one contract to the same vendor.

A proposal in response to an RFP should contain the following elements.

- **Executive summary**: High-level synopsis, features, and benefits of the proposed engagement
- **Approach and methodology**: Detailed testing procedures and technical expertise needed for the engagement
- **Project deliverables**: Types of reports that will be provided (executive summary report, technical report, and so on)
- **Project management**: Method and approach used for project management and how the engagement will proceed from start to end
- **Itemized pricing**: Details on how charges will be calculated
- **References**: Relevant references for similar work performed in the past
- **Team strength**: Biographies and relevant experience of team members
- **Company Briefing**: Information on the company with its official address, contact details, expertise in offering similar services, etc.

## Common Evaluation Criteria for Proposals

**The decision on selecting a proposalis based on the following:**

- What has been taken into consideration while deciding the operational, technical, cost, and management requirements
- Responsiveness to the RFP
- Price quoted for all the items mentioned in RFP

The client evaluates proposals based on the penetration testing organization’s considerations in deciding the operational, technical, and management requirements, as well as the total cost incurred for testing the items listed in the RPF. The client also considers the responsiveness of the penetration testing organization and its interest in the RFP. The main criterion is the price quoted by the organization for completing the project.

**The client can also consider the following primary considerations for evaluating proposals:**

- Completion of the responses mentioned in the RFP in an organized, detailed, and correct format
- Ability to propose an effective solution based on the stated requirements
- Ability to deliver the proposed service against specifications
- Experience, stability, past record, and results on similar engagements
- Ability and availability of sufficient highly skilled team members
- Experience and qualification of the key personnel assigned
- Ability to propose an effective solution including best-practice methodologies, areas of focus, and proposed tools based on the stated requirements

During evaluation, the client may ask penetration testers for an oral presentation on the proposal. This provides an opportunity for the client to ask any questions they might have on the proposals submitted.

## Preparing for Proposal Submission: Identifying Scope, Approach, and Methodology

**Sending a Preliminary Information Request Document to the Client**

The preliminary information request document provides guidelines for gathering basic information about the client’s expectations from the penetration test. It contains the client’s contact details; objectives and scope of penetration testing; a list of networks and devices such as servers, workstations, routers, firewalls, and network devices to test; and so on.

## Scoping the Penetration Test

The major goal of penetration testing is to perform a quality test of a realistic target while balancing both the time and resources of the client. To achieve this goal, penetration testers should have complete knowledge of all the possible networks, devices, infrastructure, and security that they need to test. Scoping is one of the important parts of the penetration testing engagement process. Scoping the target organization helps in assessing the possible elements and determining the approach and speed of tests, the tools required, and ROE. It further helps in preparing the test plan, limitations, business objectives, and time schedule for the proposed penetration test.

**Scoping helps define clear objectives, with which the following can be identified:**

- What will be tested

- How it should be tested

- What resources will be allocated

- What limitations will be applied

- What business objectives will be achieved

- How the test project will be planned and scheduled

The penetration test environment includes networks, applications, systems, servers, databases,   new technologies, cloud systems, Internet service providers (ISPs), and managed security service   providers (MSSPs). Penetration testers must gather the client requirements through verbal or   written communication and assess the limitations of tasks.

**The following are some key factors to consider when scoping a penetration test:**

- Target’s criticality
  The criticality of a target may vary based on the business services or activities it offers. Penetration testers should determine in advance the mission-critical systems, networks, services, and applications as part of scoping.

- Test location
  Some clients allow the penetration tester to work on site, while others prefer off-site locations as they do not want their employees to know about the test. The test location helps the penetration tester determine the approach and methodology required as well as gauge the client’s requirements.

- Test volume It is important to have an idea of the approximate number of systems involved in the test, number of IP addresses, list of web pages and parameters, and so on as this will help in determining the time and cost of the penetration test.

**The advantages of scoping a penetration test are as follows:**

- Scoping ensures the consistency and high success rate of the penetration test.

- A carefully defined scope helps in preventing collateral damage from intrusive scans or exploits.

- A lack of scoping can lead to a huge chance of failure of the penetration test because assessment requirements will have no proper definitions or procedures to follow.
- Scoping helps address all the required attributes to start the penetration testing project in a professionally sound manner.
