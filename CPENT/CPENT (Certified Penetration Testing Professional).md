  infrastructure such as network, applications, systems, and users against external as well as internal threats.
- It is an effective way of determining the efficacy of the organization’s security policies, controls, and
  technologies.
- It involves the active evaluation of the security of the organization’s infrastructure by **simulating an attack** similar to those performed by real attackers.
- During a penetration test, security measures are actively analyzed for **design weaknesses, technical flaws**, and **vulnerabilities**.

- The test results are documented and delivered in a **comprehensive report** to executive management and technical audiences.
