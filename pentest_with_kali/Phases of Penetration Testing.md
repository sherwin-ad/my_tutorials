# Phases of Penetration Testing



1. Pre-Engagement Interactions

One over-looked step to penetration testing is pre-engagement  interactions or scoping. During this pre-phase, a penetration testing  company will outline the logistics of the test, expectations, legal  implications, objectives and goals the customer would like to achieve.

During the Pre-Engagement phase, the penetration testers should work  with your company to fully understand any risks, your organizational  culture, and the best pentesting strategy for your organization. You may want to perform a [white box, black box, or gray box penetration test](https://cipher.com/pentest-and-ethical-hacking-the-beneficial-side-of-cyber-attacks). It’s at this stage when the planning occurs along with aligning your goals to specific pentesting outcomes.

Type of pentesting:

1. Black box
   - ethical hacker has no knowledge of the system being attacked
   - no information is provided to the tester 
   - they have strictly limited knowledge of the network 
   - no information on the customer’s security policies, network  structure, operating systems, software and network protection used.
2. White box
   - sharing full network and system information with the tester
   - including network maps and credentials
3. Gray
   - only limited information is shared with the tester



2. Reconnaissance or Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Gathering

Reconnaissance or Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) gathering is an  important first step in penetration testing. A pentester works on  gathering as much intelligence on your organization and the potential  targets for exploit.

Depending on which type of pentest you agree upon, your penetration  tester may have varying degrees of information about your organization  or may need to identify critical information on their own to uncover  vulnerabilities and entry points in your environment.

Common intelligence gathering techniques include:

- Search engine queries
- Domain name searches/WHOIS lookups
- Social Engineering
- Tax Records
- Internet Footprinting – email addresses, usernames, social networks,
- Internal Footprinting –Ping sweeps, port scanning, reverse DNS, packet sniffing
- Dumpster Diving
- Tailgating

A pentester uses an exhaustive checklist for finding open entry points and vulnerabilities within the organization. The [OSINT Framework](http://osintframework.com/) provides a plethora of details for open information sources.

3. Threat Modeling & Vulnerability Identification

During the threat modeling and vulnerability identification phase,  the tester identifies targets and maps the attack vectors. Any  information gathered during the Reconnaissance phase is used to inform  the method of attack during the penetration test.

The most common areas a pentester will map and identify include:

- Business assets – identify and categorize high-value assets
  - Employee data
  - Customer data
  - Technical data
- Threats – identify and categorize internal and external threats
  - Internal threats – Management, employees, vendors, etc.
  - External threats – Ports, Network Protocols, Web Applications, Network Traffic, etc.

A pentester will often use a vulnerability scanner to complete a  discovery and inventory on the security risks posed by identified  vulnerabilities. Then the pentester will validate if the vulnerability  is exploitable. The list of vulnerabilities is shared at the end of the  pentest exercise during the reporting phase.

4. Exploitation

With a map of all  possible vulnerabilities and entry points, the pentester begins to test  the exploits found within your network, applications, and data. The goal is for the ethical hacker is to see exactly how far they can get into  your environment, identify high-value targets, and avoid any detection.

If you established a  scope initially, then the pentester will only go as far as determined by the guidelines you agreed upon during the initial scoping. For example, you may define in your scope to not pentest cloud services or avoid a  zero-day attack simulation.

Some of the standard exploit tactics include:

- Web Application Attacks
- Network Attacks
- Memory-based attacks
- Wi-Fi attacks
- Zero-Day Angle
- Physical Attacks
- Social engineering

The ethical hacker will also review and document how vulnerabilities  are exploited as well as explain the techniques and tactics used to  obtain access to high-value targets. Lastly, during the exploitation  phase, the ethical hacker should explain with clarity what the results  were from the exploit on high-value targets.

5. Post-Exploitation, Risk Analysis & Recommendations

After the exploitation phase is complete, the goal is to document the methods used to gain access to your organization’s valuable  information. The penetration tester should be able to determine the  value of the compromised systems and any value associated with the  sensitive data captured.

Some pentesters are unable to quantify the impact of accessing data  or are unable to provide recommendations on how to remediate the  vulnerabilities within the environment. Make sure you ask to see a  sanitized penetration testing report that clearly shows recommendations  for fixing security holes and vulnerabilities.

Once the penetration testing recommendations are complete, the tester should clean up the environment, reconfigure any access he/she obtained to penetrate the environment, and prevent future unauthorized access  into the system through whatever means necessary.

Typical cleanup activities include:

- Removing any executables, scripts, and temporary files from compromised systems
- Reconfiguring settings back to the original parameters prior to the pentest
- Eliminating any rootkits installed in the environment
- Removing any user accounts created to connect to the compromised system

6. Reporting

Reporting is often regarded as the most critical aspect of a pentest. It’s where you will obtain written recommendations from the penetration testing company and have an opportunity to review the findings from the report with the ethical hacker(s).

The findings and detailed explanations from the report will offer you insights and opportunities to significantly improve your security  posture. The report should show you exactly how entry points were  discovered from the OSINT and Threat Modeling phase as well as how you  can remediate the security issues found during the Exploitation phase.
