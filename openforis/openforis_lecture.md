# Install Apache Tomcat 9 application server (Tomcat 10 is not supported yet):

## Check if Java is Installed

Tomcat relies on an existing [Java installation](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-java-on-centos). Check to see if your system has Java installed. Enter the following into a terminal window:

```
java -version
```

You should be running at least JDK 1.8.0. If the system reports an older version or no Java installed, install Java by entering:

```
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
```

- Install Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8+ ([download Java](http://www.java.com/))
- install PostgreSQL 8+ ([download PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/))
- create an empty database called "collect"
- download:
- the latest version of the [PostgreSQL JDBC driver](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html#current)
- the latest version of the [SQLite JDBC driver](https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/releases)
- put them into tomcat/libs folder
- download the latest version of the [Collect war file](https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=releases&g=org.openforis.collect&a=collect-webapp&v=LATEST&e=war)
- put the war file into the tomcat/webapps folder and rename it into collect.war
- download the sample [collect.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openforis/collect/master/collect-installation/collect-assembly/src/main/assembly/resources/tomcat/conf/Catalina/localhost/collect.xml) file
- modify it with the correct database connection parameters
- put it inside tomcat/conf/Catalina/localhost

## Create Tomcat User and Group

Tomcat should not be run as **root**. Create a new user and group by entering:

```
sudo useradd -m -U -d /opt/tomcat -s /bin/false tomcat
```

## Download Tomcat 9

Tomcat 9.0.20 is the latest version at the time this was written. A later release may be available on the [official download page](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi). Alternately, enter the following:

```
wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.70/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.70.tar.gz
```

### Extract the .tar.gz File

To extract the Tomcat tar.gz file to */opt/tomcat*, enter the following:

```
sudo tar xzvf apache-tomcat-9*tar.gz -C /opt/tomcat --strip-components=1
```

### Modify Tomcat User Permissions

The new tomcat user needs execute privileges over the directory.

Enter the following:

```
sudo chown -R tomcat:tomcat /opt/tomcat
```

```
sudo sh -c 'chmod +x /opt/tomcat/bin/*.sh'
```

### Create a System Unit File

Creating a systems unit file allows Tomcat to run as a service.

1. Find the Java location with the following command:

````
readlink -f $(which java)

/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.352.b08-2.el7_9.x86_64/jre/bin/java
````

Copy the parent folder of */jre/bin/java* for the following step.

2. To create a **tomcat.service** file, use the command:

```
sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/tomcat.service
```

3. In the file, enter the following:

```
[Unit]
Description=Apache Tomcat Web Application Container
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=yes

User=tomcat
Group=tomcat

Environment="JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.312.b07-1.el7_9.x86_64/"
Environment="JAVA_OPTS=-Djava.security.egd=file:///dev/urandom -Djava.awt.headless=true"
Environment="CATALINA_BASE=/opt/tomcat"
Environment="CATALINA_HOME=/opt/tomcat"
Environment="CATALINA_PID=/opt/tomcat/temp/tomcat.pid"
Environment="CATALINA_OPTS=-Xms512M -Xmx1024M -server -XX:+UseParallelGC"
ExecStart=/opt/tomcat/bin/startup.sh
ExecStop=/opt/tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Paste the path from the previous step in the **`Environment="JAVA_HOME=<path>"`** line.

4. Save and close the file.

5. Refresh the system:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

6. Set the Tomcat service to start on boot:

```
sudo systemctl enable tomcat
```

7. Start the Tomcat service:

```
sudo systemctl start tomcat
```

8. Verify that the Tomcat service is installed and running:

```
sudo systemctl status tomcat
```

## Set Up Web Management Interface

1. To create a user to access the Web Management Interface, edit the user file by entering:

```
sudo nano /opt/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml
```

2. Delete everything from the file and add the following:

```
<tomcat-users> <!-- Comments --> <role rolename="admin-gui"/> <role rolename="manager-gui"/> <user username="admin" password="good_password" roles="admin-gui,manager-gui"/> </tomcat-users>
```

Replace **good_password** with a secure password of your choosing.

Save the file and exit. You should now be able to access the Web Management Interface in a web browser. Visit **http://server_ip:8080/manager/html** to use the interface.

## Configure Remote Access (Optional)

By default, Tomcat is only accessible from the local machine itâ€™s installed on. This step allows you to grant access to a specific IP address.

\1. Edit the following file:

```
sudo nano /opt/tomcat/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml
```

\2. Add the following:

```
<Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve" allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1|192.168.0.*" />
```

\3. Save the file and exit.

\4. Repeat the process for the second file:

```
sudo nano /opt/tomcat/webapps/host-manager/META-INF/context.xml
```

\5. Add the following:

```
<Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve" allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1|192.168.0.*" />
```

\6. Save and exit.

This will grant access to any system in the **192.168.0.\*** range of IP addresses.

You can change the IP address to a specific range for your intranet. Alternately, you can use the IP address of a single system.

The **asterisk** acts as a wildcard to allow multiple IP addresses. Granting full access can leave security vulnerabilities. Instead, enable only systems with a business need to access Tomcat.
