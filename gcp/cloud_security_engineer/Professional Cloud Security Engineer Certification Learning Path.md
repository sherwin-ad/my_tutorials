# Professional Cloud Security Engineer Certification Learning Path

# Diagnostic questions



1. Cymbal Bank recently discovered service account key misuse in one of the teams during a security audit. As a precaution, going forward you do not want any team in your organization to generate new external service account keys. You also want to restrict every new service account’s usage to its associated Project. What should you do?



- Navigate to Organizational policies in the Google Cloud Console. Select your organization. Select iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation. Under Policy Enforcement, select Merge with parent. Click Save. Repeat the process for iam.disableCrossProjectServiceAccountLienRemoval.



- Run the gcloud resource-manager org-policies enable-enforce command with the constraints iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation, and iam.disableCrossProjectServiceAccountUsage and the Project IDs you want the constraints to apply to.



- Navigate to Organizational policies in the Google Cloud Console. Select your organization. Select iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation. Customize the applied to property, and set Enforcement to ‘On’. Click Save. Repeat the process for iam.disableCrossProjectServiceAccountUsage.



- Run the gcloud resource-manager org-policies allow command with the boolean constraints iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation and iam.disableCrossProjectServiceAccountUsage with Organization ID.

  

2. Cymbal Bank publishes its APIs through Apigee. Cymbal Bank has recently acquired ABC Corp, which uses a third-party identity provider. You have been tasked with connecting ABC Corp’s identity provider to Apigee for single sign-on (SSO). You need to set up SSO so that Google is the service provider. You also want to monitor and log high-risk activities. Which two choices would you select to enable SSO?

- Use openssl to generate public and private keys. Store the private key in an X.509 certificate, and encrypt using AES or DES for SAML. Sign in to the Google Admin console, and under Security, upload the certificate.

- Review Network mapping results, and assign SAML profiles to required users.

- Review Network mapping results, and assign SSO profiles to required users.

- Use openssl to generate a private key. Store the private key in an X.509 certificate, and encrypt using AES or DES for SAML. Sign in to the Google Workspace Admin Console and upload the certificate.

- Use openssl to generate public and private keys. Store the public key in an X.509 certificate, and encrypt using RSA or DSA for SAML. Sign in to the Google Admin console, and under Security, upload the certificate.



3. Cymbal Bank has certain default permissions and access for their analyst, finance, and teller teams. These teams are organized into groups that have a set of role-based IAM permissions assigned to them. After a recent acquisition of a small bank, you find that the small bank directly assigns permissions to their employees in IAM. You have been tasked with applying Cymbal Bank’s resource hierarchy to the small bank. Employees will need access to Google Cloud services. What should you do?

- Reset all user permissions in the small bank’s IAM. Use the Directory API in the Google Workspace Admin SDK to create Google Groups. Use a Python script to allocate users to the groups.

- Reset all user permissions in the small bank’s IAM. Use Cloud Identity to create dynamic groups for each of the bank’s teams. Use the dynamic groups’ metadata field for team type to allocate users to their appropriate group with a Python script.

- Reset all user permissions in the small bank’s IAM. Use Cloud Identity to create the required Google Groups. Upgrade the Google Groups to Security Groups. Use a Python script to allocate users to the groups.

- Leave all user permissions as-is in the small bank’s IAM. Use the Directory API in the Google Workspace Admin SDK to create Google Groups. Use a Python script to allocate users to the Google Groups.



4. Cymbal Bank’s organizational hierarchy divides the Organization into departments. The Engineering Department has a ‘product team’ folder. This folder contains folders for each of the bank’s products. One folder titled “analytics” contains a Google Cloud Project that contains an App Engine deployment and a Cloud SQL instance.

- Create custom roles for all three user types at the project level. For the team lead, provide all appengine.* and cloudsql.* permissions. For the developer, provide appengine.applications.* and appengine.instances.* permissions. For the code reviewer, provide the appengine.instances.* permissions.

- Assign the basic ‘Editor’ role to the team lead. Create a custom role for the developer. Provide all appengine.* permissions to the developer. Provide the predefined ‘App Engine Code Viewer’ role to the code reviewer. Assign all these permissions at the “analytics” folder level.

- Assign the basic ‘App Engine Admin’ and ‘Cloud SQL Admin” roles to the team lead. Assign the ‘App Engine Admin’ role to the developer. Assign the ‘App Engine Code Viewer’ role to the code reviewer. Assign all these permissions at the analytics project level.

- Create custom roles for all three user types at the “analytics” folder level. For the team lead, provide all appengine.* and cloudsql.* permissions. For the developer, provide appengine.applications.* and appengine.instances.* permissions. For the code reviewer, provide the appengine.instances.* permissions.

  

5. You are an administrator for Cymbal Bank’s Mobile Development Team. You want to control how long different users can access the Google Cloud console, the Cloud SDK, and any applications that require user authorization for Google Cloud scopes without having to reauthenticate. More specifically, you want users with elevated privileges (project owners and billing administrators) to reauthenticate more frequently than regular users at the organization level. What should you do?

- Create a custom role for project owners and billing administrators at the organization level in the Google Cloud console. Add the reauthenticationRequired permission to this role. Assign this role to each project owner and billing administrator.

- In the Admin console, select Google Cloud session control and set a reauthentication policy that requires reauthentication. Choose the reauthentication frequency from the drop-down list.

- Open all Google Cloud projects that belong to Cymbal Bank’s Mobile Development team. Find each project’s Google Cloud session control setting, and configure a reauthentication policy that requires reauthentication. Choose the reauthentication frequency from the drop-down list.

- Create a custom role for project owners and billing administrators at the organization level in the Google Cloud console. Add the reauthenticationRequired permission to this role. Create a Google Group that contains all billing administrators and project owners. Apply the custom role to the group.

  

6. Cymbal Bank has a team of developers and administrators working on different sets of Google Cloud resources. The Bank’s administrators should be able to access the serial ports on Compute Engine Instances and create service accounts. Developers should only be able to access serial ports. How would you design the organization hierarchy to provide the required access?

- Deny Serial Port Access and Service Account Creation at the organization level. Create a ‘dev’ folder and set enforced: true for constraints/compute.disableSerialPortAccess and enforced: true for constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountCreation. Create a new ‘admin’ folder inside the ‘dev’ folder, and set enforced: false for constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountCreation. Give developers access to the ‘dev’ folder, and administrators access to the ‘admin’ folder.

- Deny Serial Port Access and Service Account Creation at the organization level. Create a ‘dev’ folder and set enforced: false for constraints/compute.disableSerialPortAccess. Create a new ‘admin’ folder inside the ‘dev’ folder, and set enforced: false for constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountCreation. Give developers access to the ‘dev’ folder, and administrators access to the ‘admin’ folder.

- Deny Serial Port Access and Service Account Creation at the Organization level. Create an ‘admin’ folder and set enforced: false for constraints/compute.disableSerialPortAccess. Create a new ‘dev’ folder inside the ‘admin’ folder, and set enforced: false for constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountCreation. Give developers access to the ‘dev’ folder, and administrators access to the ‘admin’ folder.

- Allow Serial Port Access and Service Account Creation at the organization level. Create a ‘dev’ folder and set enforced: true for constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountCreation. Create another ‘admin’ folder that inherits from the parent inside the organization node. Give developers access to the ‘dev’ folder, and administrators access to the ‘admin’ folder.

  

7. Cymbal Bank has acquired a non-banking financial company (NBFC). This NBFC uses Active Directory as their central directory on an on-premises Windows Server. You have been tasked with migrating all the NBFC users and employee information to Cloud Identity. What should you do?

- Use Cloud VPN to connect the on-premises network to your Google Cloud environment. Select an on-premises domain-joined Windows Server. On the domain-joined Windows Server, run Configuration Manager and Google Cloud Directory Sync. Use Cloud VPN’s encrypted channel to transfer users from the on-premises Active Directory to Cloud Identity.

- Run Configuration Manager on a Compute Engine instance. Copy the resulting configuration file from this machine onto a new Compute Engine instance to keep the production environment separate from the staging environment. Leave the channel unencrypted because you are in a secure Google Cloud environment. Deploy Google Cloud Directory Sync on this new instance. Connect to the on-premises Windows Server environment from the new instance, and migrate users to Cloud Identity.

- Run Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) on a Compute Engine instance. Leave the channel unencrypted because you are in a secure Google Cloud environment. Deploy Google Cloud Directory Sync on the Compute Engine instance. Connect to the on-premises Windows Server environment from the instance, and migrate users to Cloud Identity.

- Select an on-premises domain-joined Windows Server. Run Configuration Manager on the domain-joined Windows Server, and copy the resulting configuration file to a Compute Engine instance. Run Google Cloud Directory Sync on the Compute Engine instance over the internet, and use Cloud VPN to sync users from the on-premises Active Directory to Cloud Identity.

  

8. Cymbal Bank’s organizational hierarchy divides the Organization into departments. The Engineering Department has a ‘product team’ folder. This folder contains folders for each of the bank’s products. Each product folder contains one Google Cloud Project, but more may be added. Each project contains an App Engine deployment. Cymbal Bank has hired a new technical product manager and a new web developer. The technical product manager must be able to interact with and manage all services in projects that roll up to the Engineering Department folder. The web developer needs read-only access to App Engine configurations and settings for a specific product. How should you provision the new employees’ roles into your hierarchy following principles of least privilege?

- Assign the Project Owner role in each individual project to the technical product manager. Assign the App Engine Deployer role in each individual project to the web developer.

- Assign the Project Editor role at the Engineering Department folder level to the technical product manager. Create a Custom Role in the product folder that the web developer needs access to. Add the appengine.versions.create and appengine.versions.delete permissions to that role, and assign it to the web developer.

- Assign the Project Editor role at the Engineering Department folder level to the technical product manager. Assign the App Engine Deployer role at the specific product’s folder level to the web developer.

- Assign the Project Editor role in each individual project to the technical product manager. Assign the Project Editor role in each individual project to the web developer.



9. Cymbal Bank is divided into separate departments. Each department is divided into teams. Each team works on a distinct product that requires Google Cloud resources for development. How would you design a Google Cloud organization hierarchy to best match Cymbal Bank’s organization structure and needs?

- Create an Organization node. Under the Organization node, create Department folders. Under each Department, create Product folders. Add Projects to the Product folders.

- Create an Organization node. Under the Organization node, create Department folders. Under each Department, create Product folders. Under each Product, create Teams folders. In the Teams folder, add Projects.

- Create an Organization node. Under the Organization node, create Department folders. Under each Department, create a Teams folder. Under each Team, create Product folders. Add Projects to the Product folders.

- Create an Organization node. Under the Organization node, create Department folders. Under each Department, create Teams folders. Add Projects to the Teams folders.

  

10. Cymbal Bank leverages Google Cloud storage services, an on-premises Apache Spark Cluster, and a web application hosted on a third-party cloud. The Spark cluster and web application require limited access to Cloud Storage buckets and a Cloud SQL instance for only a few hours per day. You have been tasked with sharing credentials while minimizing the risk that the credentials will be compromised. What should you do?

- Create a service account with appropriate permissions. Have the Spark Cluster and the web application authenticate as delegated requests, and share the short-lived service account credential as a JWT.

- Create a service account with appropriate permissions. Authenticate the Spark Cluster and the web application as direct requests and share the service account key.

- Create a service account with appropriate permissions. Authenticate the Spark Cluster and the web application as a delegated request, and share the service account key.

- Create a service account with appropriate permissions. Have the Spark Cluster and the web application authenticate as a direct request, and share the short-lived service account credentials as XML tokens.
