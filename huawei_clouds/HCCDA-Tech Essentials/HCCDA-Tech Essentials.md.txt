## 1. Basic Concepts and Values of Cloud Computing

### Cloud Deployment Models

**Private cloud**

- Owned and managed for exclusive use by a single organization

**Public cloud**

- Owned and managed by a third party cloud service provider and shared with multiple
  organizations over the Internet

**Hybrid cloud**

- A combination of public and private clouds, viewed as a single cloud externally



### Cloud Service Models

**Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)**

- Intended for: enterprises (or a few individual users)
- Offerings: infrastructure services such as computers, storage devices, and networks
- Examples: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, and OpenStack

**Platform as a service (PaaS)**

- Intended for: developers
- Offerings: database middleware, MySQL, MongoDB, and Java
- Examples: Cloud Foundry and OpenShift

**Software as a service (SaaS)**

- Intended for: enterprise/individual users
- Examples: enterprise application services, email, instant messaging (IM), and microblogs
