# What is DevOps?

- The contraction of "Dev" and "Ops" refers to replacing siloed Development and Operations. 
- The idea is to create multidisciplinary teams that now work together with shared and efficient practices and tools. 
- Essential DevOps practices include agile planning, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and monitoring of applications. 
- DevOps is a constant journey.

## Explore the DevOps journey

**Continuous Integration** 

- drives the ongoing merging and testing of code, leading to an early finding of defects. 
- Other benefits include less time wasted fighting merge issues and rapid feedback for development teams.

**Continuous Delivery** 

- of software solutions to production and testing environments helps organizations quickly fix bugs and respond to ever-changing business requirements.

**Version Control**

- usually with a Git-based Repository, enables teams worldwide to communicate effectively during daily development activities. 
- Also, integrate with software development tools for monitoring activities such as deployments.

**Use Agile planning and lean project management techniques to:**

- Plan and isolate work into sprints.
- Manage team capacity and help teams quickly adapt to changing business needs.
- A DevOps Definition of Done is working software collecting telemetry against the intended business goals.

**Monitoring and Logging of running applications.** 

- Including production environments for application health and customer usage. 
- It helps organizations create a hypothesis and quickly validate or disprove strategies. Rich data is captured and stored in various logging formats.

**Public and Hybrid Clouds have made the impossible easy.** 

- The cloud has removed traditional bottlenecks and helped commoditize Infrastructure. 

  You can use 

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** 

  - to lift and shift your existing apps 

- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** 

  - to gain unprecedented productivity. The cloud gives you a data center without limits.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** 

  - Enables the automation and validation of the creation and teardown of environments to help deliver secure and stable application hosting platforms.

- **Use Microservices architecture** 

  - to isolate business use cases into small reusable services that communicate via interface contracts. This architecture enables scalability and efficiency.

- **Containers are the next evolution in virtualization.** 
  - They're much more lightweight than virtual machines, allow much faster hydration, and easily configure files.
