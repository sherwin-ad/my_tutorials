    - B. You should make use of views.
    - C. You should make use of dynamic code analysis.
    - **D. You should make use of upstream sources.**

    Upstream sources enable you to manage all of your product's dependencies in a single feed. We recommend publishing all of the packages for a given product to that product's feed, and managing that product's dependencies from remote feeds in the same feed, via upstream sources. This setup has a few benefits:
    âœ‘ Simplicity: your NuGet.config, .npmrc, or settings.xml contains exactly one feed (your feed).
    âœ‘ Determinism: your feed resolves package requests in order, so rebuilding the same codebase at the same commit or changeset uses the same set of packages
    âœ‘ Provenance: your feed knows the provenance of packages it saved via upstream sources, so you can verify that you're using the original package, not a custom or malicious copy published to your feed
    âœ‘ Peace of mind: packages used via upstream sources are guaranteed to be saved in the feed on first use; if the upstream source is disabled/removed, or the remote feed goes down or deletes a package you depend on, you can continue to develop and build

    Note: Gates allow automatic collection of health signals from external services, and then promote the release when all the signals are successful at the same time or stop the deployment on timeout. Typically, gates are used in connection with incident management, problem management, change management, monitoring, and external approval systems.

    You need to prevent the configuration of the project from changing over time.
    Solution: Implement Continuous Assurance for the project.
    Does this meet the goal?

    - **A. Yes**
    - B. No

    The basic idea behind Continuous Assurance (CA) is to setup the ability to check for "drift" from what is considered a secure snapshot of a system. Support for
    Continuous Assurance lets us treat security truly as a 'state' as opposed to a 'point in time' achievement. This is particularly important in today's context when
    'continuous change' has become a norm.
    There can be two types of drift:
    âœ‘ Drift involving 'baseline' configuration: This involves settings that have a fixed number of possible states (often pre-defined/statically determined ones). For instance, a SQL DB can have TDE encryption turned ON or OFF×’â‚¬Â¦or a Storage Account may have auditing turned ON however the log retention period may be less than 365 days.
    âœ‘ Drift involving 'stateful' configuration: There are settings which cannot be constrained within a finite set of well-known states. For instance, the IP addresses configured to have access to a SQL DB can be any (arbitrary) set of IP addresses. In such scenarios, usually human judgment is initially required to determine whether a particular configuration should be considered 'secure' or not. However, once that is done, it is important to ensure that there is no "stateful drift" from the attested configuration. (E.g., if, in a troubleshooting session, someone adds the IP address of a developer machine to the list, the Continuous Assurance feature should be able to identify the drift and generate notifications/alerts or even trigger 'auto-remediation' depending on the severity of the change).

23. You are designing a configuration management solution to support five apps hosted on Azure App Service. Each app is available in the following three environments: development, test, and production.
    You need to recommend a configuration management solution that meets the following requirements:
    âœ‘ Supports feature flags
    âœ‘ Tracks configuration changes from the past 30 days
    âœ‘ Stores hierarchically structured configuration values
    âœ‘ Controls access to the configurations by using role-based access control (RBAC) permissions
    âœ‘ Stores shared values as key/value pairs that can be used by all the apps
    Which Azure service should you recommend as the configuration management solution?

    - A. Azure Cosmos DB
    - B. Azure App Service
    - **C. Azure App Configuration**
    - D. Azure Key Vault

    The Feature Manager in the Azure portal for App Configuration provides a UI for creating and managing the feature flags that you use in your applications.
    App Configuration offers the following benefits:
    âœ‘ A fully managed service that can be set up in minutes
    âœ‘ Flexible key representations and mappings
    âœ‘ Tagging with labels
    âœ‘ Point-in-time replay of settings

   Box 1: Secret -
   Store credential in Azure Key Vault by reference secret stored in key vault.
   To reference a credential stored in Azure Key Vault, you need to:

   1. Retrieve data factory managed identity
   2. Grant the managed identity access to your Azure Key Vault. In your key vault -> Access policies -> Add Access Policy, search this managed identity to grant

   Get permission in Secret permissions dropdown. It allows this designated factory to access secret in key vault.

   3. Create a linked service pointing to your Azure Key Vault.
   4. Create data store linked service, inside which reference the corresponding secret stored in key vault.

3. You plan to provision a self-hosted Linux agent.
   Which authentication mechanism should you use to register the self-hosted agent?

   - **A. personal access token (PAT)**
   - B. SSH key
   - C. Alternate credentials
   - D. certificate

   Note: PAT Supported only on Azure Pipelines and TFS 2017 and newer. After you choose PAT, paste the PAT token you created into the command prompt window. Use a personal access token (PAT) if your Azure DevOps Server or TFS instance and the agent machine are not in a trusted domain. PAT authentication is handled by your Azure DevOps Server or TFS instance instead of the domain controller.

   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/v2-linux

4. You are building a Microsoft ASP.NET application that requires authentication.
   You need to authenticate users by using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
   What should you do first?

   - A. Assign an enterprise application to users and groups
   - **B. Create an app registration in Azure AD**
   - C. Configure the application to use a SAML endpoint
   - D. Create a new OAuth token from the application
   - E. Create a membership database in an Azure SQL database

   Register your application to use Azure Active Directory. Registering the application means that your developers can use Azure AD to authenticate users and request access to user resources such as email, calendar, and documents.

   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/developer-guidance-for-integrating-applications

5. You have an Azure DevOps organization named Contoso.
   You need to recommend an authentication mechanism that meets the following requirements:
   âœ‘ Supports authentication from Git
   âœ‘ Minimizes the need to provide credentials during authentication
   What should you recommend?

   - **A. personal access tokens (PATs) in Azure DevOps**
   - B. Alternate credentials in Azure DevOps
   - C. user accounts in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
   - D. managed identities in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)

   Personal access tokens (PATs) give you access to Azure DevOps and Team Foundation Server (TFS), without using your username and password directly.
   These tokens have an expiration date from when they're created. You can restrict the scope of the data they can access. Use PATs to authenticate if you don't already have SSH keys set up on your system or if you need to restrict the permissions that are granted by the credential.
   Incorrect Answers:
   B: Azure DevOps no longer supports Alternate Credentials authentication since the beginning of March 2, 2020. If you're still using Alternate Credentials, we

    - E. an Azure Resource Manager parameter file

    When you need to pass a secure value (like a password) as a parameter during deployment, you can retrieve the value from an Azure Key Vault. You retrieve the value by referencing the key vault and secret in your parameter file. The value is never exposed because you only reference its key vault ID. The key vault can exist in a different subscription than the resource group you are deploying to.
