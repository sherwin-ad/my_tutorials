# Asterisk Lecture

- open source communications toolkit.
- communication server 

**PSTN** - Public Switched Telephone Network

**TDM (Time Division Multiplexing)** 
**PBX (Private Branch Exchange)**

**TDM PBX**

- TDM PBX is the most common type of voice  infrastructure, as it has been around the longest. This model was  designed before contemporary server technology was invented, and  therefore consists of proprietary, self-contained systems. This system  involves a cabinet with many different boards that can be purchased to  perform certain functions (such as, intercom functionality boards or  analog extension boards).

- TDM PBX boards are incompatible with all systems except those from  the same vendor as the overall architecture. This can become expensive  and limiting. These systems are outdated, and are mostly used by  companies that have not updated their network cabling.

**Hybrid PBX**

- Hybrid PBX was created when VoIP became a popular  business tool. These systems allow IP phones to connect to the PBX; it  is hybrid because it allows both IP and TDM extensions. In addition to  connecting extensions through IP, entire cabinets can be distributed and connected to the main system through IP. Many businesses that used TDM  PBX have upgraded to hybrid models.

- The advantage of the Hybrid PBX is that it cuts down on the costs of a total migration when a company wants to upgrade to VoIP. It modifies  existing infrastructure rather than requiring an entirely new system,  and is easier for users familiar with the old TDM PBX system to use.

**IP PBX** 

- IP PBX architecture involves gateways that establish links between  TDM and IP. The main system for this type of infrastructure is a server  (or multiple servers) that operates on top-performing hardware. New  applications can be added easily.

- IP PBX has many advantages, including reduced maintenance costs,  increased scalability, voice and data network integration, greater  mobility, and SIP capabilities.

**SIP**

- Session Initiation Protocol (**SIP**) is a signaling protocol used for initiating, maintaining, modifying and terminating real-time sessions that involve video, voice, messaging and other communications applications and services between two or more  endpoints on IP networks.

**IVR**

- IVR stands for Interactive Voice Response, a technology that automates  routine customer service interactions by allowing callers to interact  using touch tone digits or their voice.

## Install Asterisk

### Package Manager

```
# sudo apt install asterisk
```

### Install from source code

#### Install dependencies

astrisk-13.xx/contrib/scripts/install_prereq

**Run in test mode to print the dependencies for version**

```
# sudo ./install_prereq test
```

**Run install mode to reach out to your repos to install the dependencies for version** 

```
# sudo ./install_prereq install
```

#### Configure

```
# tar -xzvf asterisk-18-current.tar.gz
# cd asterisk-18.3.0 
# ./configure
```

#### Make

``` 
# Select modules to be installed
make menuselect

make && make install

# Copy sample config/files to /etc/asterisk
make samples

# asterisk will run in startup
make config

# systemctl start asterisk
```



#### Run linux command in Asterisk CLI

```
> !ifconfig
```

#### Run asterisk cli command in linux terminal

```
# sudo asterisk -rx 'core show version'
```



## Dialplan

- is the heart of any Asterisk system
- it defines the behavior of the system
- it consist of a list of instructions

â€‹	

### Context

- Contexts are containers that separate extensions
- [context-name]

### Extensions

- it is the mapping between a dialplan address and a named set of actions

  - Instead of an endpoint
  - Think of it more like a script
  - Each action is executed by an "application"

  extension@context

  ```
  [context]
  extension
  - application
  - application
  - application
  ```

Extension Syntax

  - Alpha-numeric names acceptable

    "1000" and "Tom" are both valid

- Syntax

  exten => name,priority,application

  exten => 1000,1,Dial (PJSIP/digium-phone)

  exten => Tom,1,Dial (PJSIP/digium-phone)

  exten => 1234,1,NoOp (Hello World!)

#### List of applications

```
asterisk*CLI> core show applications
    -= Registered Asterisk Applications =-
        AddQueueMember: Dynamically adds queue members. 
              ADSIProg: Load Asterisk ADSI Scripts into phone 
                AELSub: Launch subroutine built with AEL 
            AgentLogin: Login an agent. 
          AgentRequest: Request an agent to connect with the channel. 
                   AGI: Executes an AGI compliant application. 
         AlarmReceiver: Provide support for receiving alarm reports from a burglar or fire 
....
```

#### Info about specific application

```
asterisk*CLI> core show application Playback 

  -= Info about application 'Playback' =- 

[Synopsis]
Play a file. 

[Description]
Plays back given filenames (do not put extension of wav/alaw etc). The playback
command answer the channel if no options are specified. If the file is
non-existant it will fail
This application sets the following channel variable upon completion:
${PLAYBACKSTATUS}: The status of the playback attempt as a text string.
    SUCCESS
    FAILED
See Also: Background (application) -- for playing sound files that are
interruptible
WaitExten (application) -- wait for digits from caller, optionally play music
on hold

[Syntax]
Playback(filename[&filename2[&...]][,options])
```



##  Check the asterisk is working

```
# sudo asterisk -r
```

## Channel

A channel is a pathway in and out of Asterisk

- **SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)**

  - is a signaling protocol used for initiating, maintaining, modifying and terminating real-time sessions that involve video, voice, messaging and other communications applications and services between two or more  endpoints on IP networks.

- **IAX (Inter-Asterisk eXchange)**

  - is a [communications protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol) native to the [Asterisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk_(PBX)) [private branch exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_branch_exchange) (PBX) software, and is supported by a few other [softswitches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softswitch), PBX systems, and softphones.  It is used for transporting [VoIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoIP) telephony sessions [between servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-server) and to terminal devices.
  - IAX is a [VoIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoIP) protocol that can be used for any type of streaming media including video, but is mainly designed for IP voice calls.
  - IAX uses a single [User Datagram Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol) (UDP) data stream between endpoints for both the session [signaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(information_theory)) and the media payloads. Thus it uses only a single UDP [port number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_number), typically **4569**. 

- **DAHDI (Digium Asterisk Hardware Device Interface)**
